# Machine Learning for Resource Constrained Devices.

As the domain of machine learning concepts in increasing day by day implementation of those are very limited since they require huge resources. We aim to reduce the resources required for such concepts and to make them implementable in resource constrained device.

  its a pickle file divided into 6 parts: Training(X and y) Validation (X and y) Test (X and y)

Params Range : 0 to 25600
Things to Note: Acc, Time for test vs Memory Size required.
  For each model with different memory sizes.
